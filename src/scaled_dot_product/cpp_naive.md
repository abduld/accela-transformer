# Naive C++

We implement a naive C++ scaled dot product as

[](cpp_naive.cpp ':include :type=code cpp :fragment=scaled-dot-product')
 
With the following inputs and output:

[](cpp_naive.cpp ':include :type=code cpp :fragment=declare-io')
 

Where the `row_softmax` function is defined as:

[](cpp_naive.cpp ':include :type=code cpp :fragment=row-softmax')
