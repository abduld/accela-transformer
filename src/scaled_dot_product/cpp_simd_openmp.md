# Vectorized C++ Using OpenMP

We implement a vectorized scaled dot product in C++ using OpenMP annotations.

[](cpp_simd_openmp.cpp ':include :type=code cpp :fragment=scaled-dot-product')
 

Where the `row_softmax` function is defined as:

[](cpp_simd_openmp.cpp ':include :type=code cpp :fragment=row-softmax')
